In this folder you can find two different scripts. One developed with Jupyter Notebook (python) and another one with RStudio. The first one uses a Neural Network in order to predict if a shape, based on different parameters (Area, Circularity, Eccentricity), is a cluster or not. The second one does the same but with kernlab.
Once developed the models, the one I've found more accurate is the kernlab one, with RStudio. The df_combinado.csv is the file with the training data. Studying the colinearity It's been found that only Area, Circularity and Eccentricity are independent, those are the input used to develope the models.

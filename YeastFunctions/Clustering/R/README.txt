In order to preprocess the data, it's been developed the file 'classification_cells_not_wanted.rds', a kernlab model developed with the library Caret to distinguish between weird shaped yeast cells (because of the binarization) from normal shaped cells.
This RDS file has been created using the 'predict_weird_shape_kernlab_model.rmd' file and the database folder. It can be improved and retrained. To implement the filtering, you can follow the first lines of the 'check_population_equality.Rmd' file.

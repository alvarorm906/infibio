In order to preprocess the data, it's been developed the file 'classification_cells_not_wanted.rds', inside the 'Cluster analysis' folder, a kernlab model developed with the library Caret to distinguish between weird shaped yeast cells (because of the binarization) from normal shaped cells.
This RDS file has been created using the 'predict_weird_shape_kernlab_model.rmd' file and the database 'labeled' folder. It can be improved and retrained. To implement the filtering, you can follow the first lines of the 'check_population_equality.Rmd' file.

In the cluster analysis folder there's the 'cluster_analysis.R' file that uses the functions developed in the functions folder to analyse a given folder with the csv files with the features obtaind from regionprops, and apply directly a csv combination from all the pictures, remove weird shapes and saving the plots and analysis. Plots function is ready to be used, tests function needs to sort out how to save the results. The idea is to loop over different folders to automatically obtain the results.
